[DigitalOcean][1] offers very cheap VPNs starting at just \$5 a month, with servers in both US and Europe.

## Buy a VPN for less than a Coffee

Since I generally spend more than \$5 a day for coffee I thought I'd skip just one coffee a month and treat myself to a VPN. From what I've seen so far their setup isn't as advanced as [Linode][2]. But for 1/4 the price it's a bargain.

Now I just have to figure out what to do with it.

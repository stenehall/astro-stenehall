## [Ember.js][1] and Apps

With 0.5 Ghost will start using Ember for the admin interface and will also support apps. Apps is Ghosts solution for plugins/modules or whatever you want to call it.

This opens up for more developers to contibute with their apps. I for one will try to implement a solution for post specific images so that I finaly can move my jekyll powered blog over to Ghost.
